# Templ Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the home page component using Templ templates with Datastar for reactivity and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## What was created:

### 1. Shared Types (`types/user.go`)
- Created shared `User` type to avoid import cycles
- Used by all components and layouts

### 2. Layout Components (`layouts/`)
- `base.templ` - Main HTML layout with navigation, footer, and toast notifications
- Includes Tailwind CSS, Datastar JS, and custom styles
- Responsive design with mobile menu support

### 3. UI Components (`components/`)
- `nav.templ` - Navigation bar with user authentication state
- `footer.templ` - Footer with Bitcoin branding
- Components are reusable across different pages

### 4. Page Components (`pages/`)
- `home.templ` - Complete home page with:
  - Hero section with Bitcoin branding
  - Feature highlights (Lightning fast, low fees, self-sovereign)
  - How it works section (3-step process)
  - Different CTAs based on user authentication state
  - Merchant onboarding CTA
  - Interactive Datastar demo component

### 5. Static Assets
- `static/css/app.css` - Custom CSS with Bitcoin-themed styling and utility classes
- `static/js/app.js` - JavaScript utilities for Bitcoin formatting and Datastar integration

### 6. Test Server (`cmd/test/main.go`)
- Simple test server to preview components without database/Redis
- Routes for different user states:
  - `/` - Home page (no user)
  - `/user` - Home page (customer)
  - `/merchant` - Home page (merchant)
  - `/health` - Health check

### 7. Updated Main Server (`cmd/server/main.go`)
- Integrated Templ home page into main application
- Uses shared User types
- Ready for authentication integration

## Features Implemented:

1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
2. **Interactive Elements**: Datastar for client-side reactivity
3. **Bitcoin-Native UX**: 
   - Bitcoin amount formatting (sats, mBTC, BTC)
   - Orange color scheme
   - Lightning and Bitcoin iconography
4. **User State Management**: Different UI based on user authentication and role
5. **Toast Notifications**: Global notification system
6. **SEO Ready**: Proper meta tags and semantic HTML

## Testing:
- All code compiles successfully
- Test server runs without errors
- Components are ready for integration with authentication

## Next Steps:
1. Integrate authentication to populate real user data
2. Create additional pages (menu, orders, auth forms)
3. Add more interactive features with Datastar
4. Set up real database and Redis for full functionality

The foundation for the hypermedia UI is now complete and ready for further development.
