# Phase 2: Entity Layer Integration - Completion Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 successfully implemented the integration between Order and MenuItem entities at the domain layer, establishing a rich domain model with encapsulated business logic and Bitcoin-based pricing.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Rich MenuItem Entity Implementation
- **Location**: `/internal/menu/entity.go`
- **Key Features**:
  - Encapsulated fields with public getters
  - Business logic methods for stock management
  - Price management in Bitcoin (Satoshis)
  - Stock reservation and release mechanisms
  - Availability management separate from stock levels
  - Creation of OrderItems with automatic stock reservation

### 2. Stock Management System
- **Unlimited Stock**: Default state with value `-1`
- **Limited Stock**: Positive integer values
- **Zero Stock**: Automatically makes item unavailable
- **Stock Operations**:
  - `ReserveStock()`: Decrements stock when creating order items
  - `ReleaseStock()`: Increments stock when orders are cancelled
  - `CanFulfillQuantity()`: Checks availability before reservation

### 3. Bitcoin Pricing Integration
- **Base Unit**: Satoshis (1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis)
- **Display Logic**:
  - Small amounts: Displayed in Satoshis (e.g., "5000 sats")
  - Medium amounts: Displayed in mBTC (e.g., "50.000 mBTC")
  - Large amounts: Displayed in BTC (e.g., "1.00000000 BTC")
- **Price Immutability**: Order items snapshot prices at creation time

### 4. Entity Integration Points

#### Order → MenuItem Flow:
1. MenuItem creates OrderItem with `CreateOrderItem(quantity)`
2. Stock is automatically reserved during creation
3. OrderItem contains snapshot of price and item details
4. Order aggregates OrderItems and calculates totals

#### Key Integration Features:
- **Price Immutability**: Menu price changes don't affect existing orders
- **Stock Isolation**: Each order reserves stock independently
- **State Independence**: Order and MenuItem maintain separate state

### 5. Comprehensive Test Coverage

#### Entity Tests:
- `/internal/order/entity_test.go`: Order aggregate behavior
- `/internal/menu/entity_test.go`: MenuItem domain logic
- `/internal/order/value_objects_test.go`: Money value object

#### Integration Tests:
- `/internal/integration/order_menu_test.go`: Full workflow testing
  - Order creation with menu items
  - Stock management workflows
  - Price immutability verification
  - Complex multi-order scenarios

### 6. Domain Events Structure
Maintained event-driven architecture for future integration:
- OrderPlacedEvent
- OrderAcceptedEvent
- OrderCancelledEvent
- OrderCompletedEvent

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Entity-First Design
- All business logic resides in entities
- Entities are self-validating
- State transitions are controlled by the entity

### 2. Value Objects
- Money as immutable value object
- Address as structured value object
- DeliveryMethod as enumerated type

### 3. Encapsulation Strategy
- Private fields with public getters
- Business operations through methods only
- Validation in constructors and setters

### 4. Stock Management Philosophy
- Optimistic reservation (reserve on order creation)
- Manual release on cancellation (for use case flexibility)
- Unlimited stock as special case (-1)

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
1. `/internal/menu/entity.go` - Rich MenuItem entity
2. `/internal/menu/entity_test.go` - MenuItem tests
3. `/internal/integration/order_menu_test.go` - Integration tests
4. `/docs/phase2-summary.md` - This summary

### Modified Files:
1. `/internal/order/entity.go` - Enhanced with proper getters
2. `/internal/order/value_objects.go` - Bitcoin pricing implementation

### Temporarily Isolated:
- Repository implementations (postgres, in-memory)
- HTTP handlers
- Use cases
(These will be updated in Phase 3)

## Test Results
```
✅ Order Entity Tests: ALL PASS
✅ Menu Entity Tests: ALL PASS  
✅ Integration Tests: ALL PASS
```

## Domain Model Benefits

### 1. Testability
- Entities can be tested in isolation
- No external dependencies needed
- Clear behavior verification

### 2. Business Logic Protection
- Invariants enforced at entity level
- Invalid state transitions prevented
- Consistent validation

### 3. Future Extensibility
- Event sourcing ready
- Easy to add new business rules
- Clear boundaries for each aggregate

## Next Phase (Phase 3)

### Recommended Focus Areas:
1. **Use Case Layer Integration**
   - Update PlaceOrderUseCase to use rich entities
   - Implement stock release on order cancellation
   - Add menu item management use cases

2. **Repository Pattern Updates**
   - Adapt repositories to work with private fields
   - Implement proper entity reconstruction
   - Add menu repository implementation

3. **HTTP Handler Updates**
   - Update DTOs to match entity structure
   - Add menu management endpoints
   - Implement proper error handling

4. **Additional Features**
   - Order modification (add/remove items)
   - Scheduled ordering
   - Merchant menu management
   - Stock alerts and notifications

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully established a robust, entity-driven domain model with proper integration between Order and MenuItem aggregates. The implementation follows Domain-Driven Design principles with:

- **Rich domain entities** with encapsulated state and behavior
- **Bitcoin-based pricing** throughout the system
- **Comprehensive stock management** with reservation/release
- **Complete test coverage** at both unit and integration levels

The foundation is now solid for building the application layers (use cases, repositories, handlers) on top of this rich domain model.
